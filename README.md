## Technologies 

- **React:** Popular open‑source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.
- **React Router (v7):** Routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade.
- **Puter.com:** An advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and highly extensible.
- **Puter.js:** A tiny client‑side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app.
- **Tailwind CSS** Utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.
- **TypeScript** Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers, making it ideal for building large-scale applications.
- **Zustand** Minimal, hook-based state management library for React.
